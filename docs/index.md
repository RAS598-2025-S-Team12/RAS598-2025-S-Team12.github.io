## II. Project
### i. Project description
1. Concept:
> Our project combines a UR5 robotic arm with a Turtlebot to create an automated delivery robot systems. We will set up three cargo stations (A, B, C) and three different types of cargo (a, b, c). The UR5 robotic arm will randomly transfer the cargo onto the Turtlebot, and after the Turtlebot reads the cargo's Aruco marker, it will deliver the corresponding cargo to the designated station.

2. The research question this project seeks to answer is: 
  To present how can the integration of a UR5 robotic arm and a Turtlebot automate and optimize the process of sorting and delivering different types of goods to designated stations.

### ii. Sensor Integration
> The LiDAR will be used to collect a 3D point cloud and convert it into a map. During testing, we ensure that the LiDAR accurately maps the environment and effectively avoids obstacles by comparing real-time data with the generated map. The IMU is evaluated to confirm that it precisely measures movement and maintains stability, which is vital for the robot's mobility. Additionally, the cameraâ€™s ability to recognize ArUco markers under various conditions will be tested, addressing potential issues like lighting changes or occlusion. In the final demonstration, the LiDAR will be fully integrated to enable smooth navigation, ensuring that the Turtlebot moves efficiently without collisions. The IMU will be used to maintain the Turtlebot's balance and ensure stable movement during delivery tasks, and the camera will reliably identify markers to direct the Turtlebot to the correct station for each cargo.

### vi. Final Demonstrartion
1. What resources will you need?
  * The reference project on internet like similar projects in Github and any materials given by Prof.Aukes.
  * UR5 robotic arm and turtlebot robot
  * Sensor like IMU, LIDAR, encoders, etc.
  * High-performance computer
  
2. Describe the classroom setup requirements. 
  * UR5 robot arm
  * A few small boxes
  * Several boards make up the obstacle course. 
  * Enough space for robotic operation

3. Conditions change in any environment. How will your robot handle variability in its environment?
>  We will test under serval different obstacle conditions to ensure that the robot are robust enough to handle variability.

4. Testing & Evaluation plan: Please describe how you can verify your system is working as expected?
>  We will conduct several tests to see if the robot works accurately. We will compare the sensor data and analog outputs to real-world conditions to ensure that our designed algorithms can accurately adapt to environmental changes.
