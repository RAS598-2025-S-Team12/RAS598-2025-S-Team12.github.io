# Project Overview

## Scope
This project aims to develop an automated delivery system by integrating a UR5 robotic arm with a TurtleBot. Two workstations, A and B, will be set up alongside red and blue blocks. The UR5 arm will transfer the colored blocks onto the TurtleBot, which will then identify each block’s color and autonomously navigate to deliver it to the designated workstation. Through this integration, we seek to optimize the sorting and delivery workflow.

## Data Acquisition & Filtering
* **LiDAR** → 3‑D point‑cloud mapping and obstacle detection.  
* **IMU** → Motion & stability feedback.  
* **Camera (RGB)** → Colour recognition under variable lighting.

The LiDAR will be used to collect a 3D point cloud and convert it into a map. During testing, we ensure that the LiDAR accurately senses the environment with real-time data to generate the complete map. The IMU is evaluated to confirm that it precisely measures movement and maintains stability, which is crucial for the robot's mobility. Additionally, the camera’s ability to recognize colors under various conditions will be tested. In the final demonstration, the LiDAR will be fully integrated to enable smooth navigation, ensuring that the Turtlebot moves efficiently towards workstations with the ability to avoid obstacles without collision. The IMU will be used to maintain the Turtlebot's balance and ensure stable movement during delivery tasks.

## Interaction (RViz)
We will use RViz to visualize the turtlebot states, LiDAR data, environment map, tf frames, navigation goals (two workstations), the planned path generated by Nav2, and debugging in real-time.

## Control & Autonomy
The processed sensor data enables real-time responses such as collision avoidance, stability adjustments, and immediate path corrections. For instance, the LiDAR data helps detect obstacles, while the IMU provides vital motion and balance information. At the higher level, the controller uses the refined sensor data to update path planning, ensuring the Turtlebot navigates efficiently and delivers blocks to the designated workstation based on color recognition.

## Development Prerequisites
1. Configure UR5 ⇌ TurtleBot communication (ROS 2).  
2. Select an efficient path‑planning algorithm (A*, Dijkstra, or alternative).  
3. Integrate Python libraries such as OpenCV for object detection.

To build the system, we need to understand how communication between UR5 and TurtleBot 4 works. Choosing the most suitable path-planning algorithm is crucial for efficient TurtleBot 4 navigation and minimizing delivery time. Lastly, integrating useful Python packages like OpenCV for object detection will enhance the system's capabilities.

# Final Demonstration

## Resources Required
- UR5 arm & TurtleBot 4
- IMU, LiDAR, wheel encoders
- High‑performance workstation
- Reference projects (e.g., GitHub) & course material given by Prof. Aukes.

## Classroom Setup
- UR5 robot arm and gripper
- Small blocks (red/blue)
- Several boards make up the obstacle course. 
- Enough space for robotic operation

## Test Matrix
- Robustness is evaluated under varied obstacle layouts. Accuracy metrics compare sensor data against ground truth to validate adaptability.

We will test under several different obstacle conditions to ensure that the robot are robust enough to handle variability. Several tests will be conducted to see if the robot works accurately. Comparing the sensor data and analog outputs to real-world conditions to ensure that our designed algorithms can accurately adapt to environmental changes.

# Impact
This project will enhance our understanding of multi-robot communication by coordinating the UR5 robotic arm and TurtleBot 4. Building an Rviz simulation will help us simulate and test the system. Developing our own user interface will improve interaction and control. Lastly, exploring different path-planning algorithms will deepen our knowledge of autonomous navigation.

# Advising
Dr. Aukes serves as our advisor for this project, providing technical guidance and hardware support. With his expertise in ROS2 development, robotic motion planning, and control systems, he plays a crucial role in helping us navigate the technical challenges of integrating the UR5 robotic arm and Turtlebot. Additionally, we plan to seek further technical guidance from other experts in the field to ensure the success of our project.

# Project Progress

## Achievements

### 1 UR5 Pick‑and‑Place
*We successfully implemented control over the UR5 robotic arm, enabling it to perform pick-and-place tasks from point A to point B.*

### 2 GUI Enhancement
*Added an "Origin" button based on the previously developed GUI. After initiating the system with the "Start" button, pressing "Origin" commands the Turtlebot to move to the designated position and wait to receive colored blocks.*

### 3 Pre‑defined Actions
*We successfully enabled the TurtleBot to execute predefined actions. When button A is pressed, it moves forward 3 meters and then turns left for 1 meter; when button B is pressed, it moves forward 3 meters and then turns right for 1 meter.*

### 4 Initial Path Planning (Nav2)
Created an initial version of path planning within ttb_nav.py, incorporating obstacle detection and avoidance using ROS2's Nav2 framework.

# Code Breakdown

## GUI (`gui.py`)
1. The [`gui.py`](https://github.com/RAS598-2025-S-Team12/RAS598-2025-S-Team12.github.io/blob/main/src/t12_prj/t12_prj/gui.py), defines a TurtleBotGUI class that inherits from both rclpy.Node and QtWidgets.QMainWindow, integrating a PyQt5 interface with ROS2 communication.<br>
2. It creates publishers for `/turtlebot_state`, `/gui_cmd_vel`, and `/simple_goal`, and subscribers for `/default_vel`, `/c3_14/odom`, and `/c3_14/imu`, handling state, velocity commands, odometry, and IMU data.<br>
3. The GUI layout comprises a read-only logging panel, a Matplotlib canvas plotting raw and FIR-filtered linear acceleration over time, and text fields displaying current linear and angular velocities.<br>
4. Spin-box controls with Reset/Send buttons enable manual velocity entry, while large START/STOP and A/B/Origin buttons toggle operation and dispatch predefined navigation goals, each action logged with a timestamp.<br>
5. Callback methods (odom_callback, imu_callback) update velocity displays and append IMU samples to a rolling buffer; update_plot applies a moving-average filter to the latest N samples before redrawing the acceleration graph.<br>

## UR5 Control Nodes
1. The ROS2 nodes, implemented in Python, include:<br>
  - [`move_to_position.py`](https://github.com/RAS598-2025-S-Team12/RAS598-2025-S-Team12.github.io/blob/main/src/ur5_control/ur5_control/move_to_position.py): sends trajectory commands to control robot motion.<br>
  - [`get_position.py`](https://github.com/RAS598-2025-S-Team12/RAS598-2025-S-Team12.github.io/blob/main/src/ur5_control/ur5_control/get_position.py): subscribes and monitors robot joint states and end-effector poses.<br>
2. Publishers and subscribers involved:<br>
  - Publishes JointTrajectory messages to `/scaled_joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory`.<br>
  - Subscribes to `/joint_states for joint angles`.<br>
  - Subscribes to `/tcp_pose_broadcaster/pose` for end-effector position feedback.<br>
3. Motion strategy:<br>
  - Vertical pick-and-place movements utilize linear trajectory commands (moveL) for precision.<br>
  - Horizontal movements employ joint-space trajectory commands (moveJ) for efficient operation.<br>
4. Feedback system:<br>
- Continuously monitors joint angles and end-effector positions.<br>
- Ensures closed-loop accuracy for task execution.<br>

## URSim & Physical Robot
1. Validation environment:<br>
- Official Universal Robots ursim_e-series simulation software validates the ROS2 node performance.<br>
