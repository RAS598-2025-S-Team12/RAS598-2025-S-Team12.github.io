## II. Project
### i. Project description
Our project combines a UR5 robotic arm with a Turtlebot to create an automated delivery robot systems. We will set up three cargo stations (A, B, C) and three different types of cargo (a, b, c). The UR5 robotic arm will randomly transfer the cargo onto the Turtlebot, and after the Turtlebot reads the cargo's Aruco marker, it will deliver the corresponding cargo to the designated station.

### vi. Final Demonstrartion
1. What resources will you need?
* The reference project on internet like similar projects in Github and any materials given by Prof.Aukes.
* UR5 robotic arm and turtlebot robot
* Sensor like IMU, LIDAR, encoders, etc.
* High-performance computer
1. Describe the classroom setup requirements. 
* UR5 robot arm
* A few small boxes
* Several boards make up the obstacle course. 
* Enough space for robotic operation
1. Conditions change in any environment. How will your robot handle variability in its environment? 
A: We will test under serval different obstacle conditions to ensure that the robot are robust enough to handle variability.
1. Testing & Evaluation plan: Please describe how you can verify your system is working as expected?
A: We will conduct several tests to see if the robot works accurately. We will compare the sensor data and analog outputs to real-world conditions to ensure that our designed algorithms can accurately adapt to environmental changes.
