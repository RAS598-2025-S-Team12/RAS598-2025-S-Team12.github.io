state_callback sets \naction_in_progress (\u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d or None) based on incoming state strings.\n\nd) The vel_callback watches for consecutive zero-velocity Twist messages during an active action, stamping the first zero-command time, \nwhile non-zero commands reset that timer.\n\ne) Every second, check_arrival_condition checks if the robot has held zero velocity for more than 3 seconds during an action\u2014if so, it \npublishes either \u201cArrived at A\u201d or \u201cArrived at B\u201d and then clears the action state.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Turtlebot Navigation</p> <pre><code>a) The [`ttb_nav.py`](https://github.com/RAS598-2025-S-Team12/RAS598-2025-S-Team12.github.io/blob/main/src/t12_prj/t12_prj/ttb_nav.py) \ndefines a TtbNav class that inherits from rclpy.Node, implementing a navigation state machine which listens to `/turtlebot_state` \ncommands and translates them into Nav2 NavigateToPose goals.\n\nb) It retrieves three parameters `origin_pos`, `ws1_pos`, `ws2_pos` as [x, y, yaw_deg] from [`ttb_pos_point.yaml`](https://github.com/RAS598-2025-S-Team12/RAS598-2025-S-Team12.github.io/blob/main/src/t12_prj/config/ttb_pos_point.yaml), logs \nthese goal positions, initializes an ActionClient for the `navigate_to_pose` action server, and subscribes to `/turtlebot_state`, while \ntracking the last sent goal with `current_goal_tag`.\n\nc) The state_cb callback strips and logs each incoming state string, ignores `Idle` or `AtLoad`, then maps \"StartReturn\"/\"Origin\" \u2192 \n`origin`, \"StartDelivery1\" \u2192 `ws1`, \"StartDelivery2\" \u2192 `ws2`, invoking `send_goal` only if the requested tag differs from \n`current_goal_tag`.\n\nd) The send_goal(pos_xyz, tag) method converts the [x, y, yaw_deg] tuple into a PoseStamped (using quaternion_from_euler for the yaw), \nstamps it in the map frame with the current time, logs the outgoing goal, updates `current_goal_tag`, and calls `send_goal_async` with \n`feedback_cb` attached.\n\ne) The feedback and result callbacks handle the rest: `feedback_cb` logs the remaining distance, `goal_resp_cb` checks acceptance \n(resetting the tag on rejection and chaining `result_cb`), and `result_cb` logs success, cancellation or failure, then clears \n`current_goal_tag` so new goals can be sent.\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"charts/","title":"Charts","text":"<pre><code>\ngraph TD\n    Start[System Start] --&gt;
